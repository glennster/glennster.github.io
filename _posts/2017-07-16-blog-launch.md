Finally got around to creating my blog on GitHub.  I have seen a lot in my 30 years in technology and I will share some of the things I have learned here.
I first started programming in Basica on a TRS-80, later moved to Fortran and then to C/C++, Java and Python.
I started using the internet on Unix using Mosaic and ftp.
